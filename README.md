- 👋 Hi, I’m @aarxnp1
- 👀 I’m interested in front-end development, film & tv, and video-games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python3 and Responsive Web Design, both through FCC courses.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on absolutely anything, I love expressing my creatively any way possible. I've only began learning coding very recently so don't expect much from me technically lol.
- 📫 How to reach me -- discord: Aaronn#4166
